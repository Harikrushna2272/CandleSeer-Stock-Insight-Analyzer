"CandleSeer: Stock Insight Analyzer"

- It emphasizes the systemâ€™s ability to "see" patterns in candlestick charts and provide insights into stock price movements.

- This project is a stock analysis and technical pattern screener designed to assist traders and investors in identifying key patterns in historical stock price data. It leverages candlestick pattern recognition and price movement analysis to detect signals like consolidations, breakouts, and various candlestick formations (e.g., Morning Star, Doji, Engulfing). The system uses Yahoo Finance to fetch historical stock data and TA-Lib for technical analysis. The web-based interface allows users to scan for specific patterns and analyze stock behavior effortlessly.

Key features:

- Candlestick Pattern Detection: Identifies patterns such as Morning Star, Hammer, Engulfing, and more for informed decision-making.
- Consolidation and Breakout Analysis: Highlights stocks consolidating in a tight range or breaking out.
- Web Interface: User-friendly interface for real-time scanning of candlestick patterns across multiple stocks.
